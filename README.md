# Iris_EDA

This project seems to revolve around exploring and visualizing the Iris dataset, which is commonly used in data analytics and machine learning. Here's a breakdown of the tasks involved:

Data Understanding: This phase involves familiarizing oneself with the dataset, understanding its structure, and the meaning of each feature.

Data Processing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis.

Data Analyzing: Analyzing the dataset involves exploring relationships between variables, identifying patterns, and gaining insights from the data.

Data Visualization: Visualization is crucial for understanding data patterns and communicating findings effectively. This involves creating various plots and charts to represent different aspects of the dataset.

# Here are the specific tasks listed for this project:

Line Plot: Create a line graph to display the sepal length of the three species of Iris flowers over some dimension (e.g., time). Each species should be represented by a different color.

Scatter Plot: Construct a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between petal length and petal width. Each species should be differentiated by color.

Histogram: Plot a histogram to depict the distribution of petal widths across the dataset. Each species should be represented by a different color, and a legend should be included for clarity.

Bar Plot: Generate a bar plot to show the average sepal width for each species of Iris flowers.

Pie Chart: Assuming the dataset represents the entire population of Iris flowers, create a pie chart to display the proportion of each species in the population.

Box Plot: Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of sepal length for each species of Iris flowers.

Each of these visualizations will provide valuable insights into the characteristics of the Iris dataset and can aid in further analysis or modeling tasks.
